Why are TMT rebars preferred to normal steel bars?
TMT bars are one of the most popular and preferred choices by millions of engineers and builders. It is hugely popular and one of the most preferred construction materials compared to normal steel bars. There must be reasons for it being the’ endorsed one. Do you know why?
One of the unique features of a Thermo Mechanically Treated bars (TMT bars) is that it acts as a reinforcement with concrete and protects the structure of a building from any kind of wear and tear that may occur during any natural disasters. TMT bars are also known as rebars or reinforcing bars in engineering terminology. It is defined on the principle of a high-strength reinforced bar with a soft inner core and tough outer core. TMT bars have proved itselves time and again that it is extremely viable for reinforced structures, minimizing the damages and creating resistance against compressive forces. 

So, what makes TMT steel bars stand apart from normal steel bars? It is the unique properties it has; let's see what they are: 

Tensile strength 
TMT bars have some of the highest value when it comes to yield strength, compared to any other ordinary steel bar. The tensile strength of a TMT steel bar helps in taking the extra load on the structural element. 

Ductility
Ductility is one of the most significant qualities of a TMT bar. It allows the superior protection of buildings against any kind of structural collapse and rupture. Furthermore, TMT bars acquire 20 percent extra strength compared to any other ordinary steel bar. 

Elongation
Elongation plays another important role in a steel bar’s ductility. Due to a higher percentage of ductility in a steel bar, the chance of damages to a building are lesser.
The higher the percentage of the elongation, the higher will be the ductility. TMT bars are created from a strong hard layer and a soft inner core that makes it truly flexible and strong. 

Bendability
It is very important to give TMT steel bars the desired shape, and that includes beam-column joints that have end-connection. The signature inner soft core of a TMT steel bar allows them to achieve various shapes and further bending and re-bending properties are also part of it. This feature allows TMT steel bars to be easily worked during a construction project. Keeping these considerations in mind, it is preferred as one the best TMT steel for house construction projects. 

Due to a sudden rise in the construction industry in India, there has been a tremendous growth of new-age high tensile TMT steel bars manufacturers. India has positioned itself as the second highest steel producers and manufacturers in the world. You may also find some of the best quality TMT steel bars suppliers in India, but then if you look closely, South India is becoming one of the biggest hubs for construction projects. Some of the prominent steel manufacturers such as Bharathi TMT, is also considered as one of the best steel bar manufacturers in Kerala. With more than 50 years in the field of the construction industry, Bharathi TMT has positioned the name as one of the Best Steel bars in Kerala.
